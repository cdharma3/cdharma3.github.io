I broke up my walkthrough into a few bulleted points organized into the pages that I have for the website:

- Home Page
	- My home page has a picture of me along with a small introduction and link to my other materials
	- I really wanted to finish up my hobbies sections with a few pictures and other materials, but I wanted to get express permission from the people in the photo to use it for a public site and I wasn't able to get that from them quickly enough
