            <h3>Timings Comparison Application</h3>
            <p>Company: Teradyne</p>
            <p>When: Summer 2021</p>
            <p>The timings comparison application is an application created by a team of three interns working in an agile based
            project during the summer. The application is a GUI based application written in C#, it takes two log files stored in a 
            CSV file and graphically displays the differences between the log files. </p>

            <p>We scoped and planned the majority of the project ourselves, only receiving a minor set of requirements from our mentors. 
            The entire project was done using the Agile methodology, our team was responsible with writing user stories and planning
            the two week sprints the project was broken up into.               
            </p>

            <p>My primary responsiblities included designing and coding the comparison backend that performed the comparisons between the 
            log file entries, aiding in the integration of the GUI with said backend and integration testing.

            <h3>Parking R' Us</h3>
            <p>Class: CS 425 - Database Organization</p>
            <p>When: Spring 2019</p>
            <p>Collaborated with two partners to design an app to automate the process of finding a parking spot in crowded lots.
                I was reponsible for designing the backend database integration and worked with PostgreSQL. </p>
            
            <p>Our frontend is coded in Java, and uses a locally hosted PostgreSQL server for database management.

            <p>Hackathon: Demonhacks 2019</p>

                An Alexa based application that was meant to take in as input a list of symptoms and attempt to diagnose common issues.
                This application had web integration in order to process the list of symptoms and attempt to make its best guess as to the
                nature of the user's illness. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I was responsible for creating the Alexa Skill front end and integrating it into our web server, where my partners were 
                developing both the processing and response to the user. I utilized the Alexa Skill Development Kit and worked with its natural 
                language processor.
